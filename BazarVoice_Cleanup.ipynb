If we take the words and we specify 'v' inside the lemmatize() function, then the words are treated as verbs and nltk lemmatizes them assuming that they are verbs. Not all the words will get lemmatized at this stage, We'll apply the lemmatization function again, using 'n' inside of lemmatize(). This way, we will assume that all the words are nouns. Using this approach, the context of the words and their actual part of speech is not accounted for.\n",
